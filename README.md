listo is a todo list app created to help me stay organized and not forget things! 

Inspired by [Microsoft Todo](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/)

Users can create multiple Lists, add Items to these Lists and specify due dates, quantities, and notes. A dashboard  shows statistics, and an overview of what Items are due.

I use listo daily and it's currently running on my home network, served from my rasperry pi.

Written with React, tailwindcss, Express, Node, SQLite and Docker.
